      <description>There are many pre-built solutions for setting up a Laravel + Docker environment, they&amp;rsquo;re all excellent solutions, but too complex for my needs 90% of the times.
It&amp;rsquo; s the boilerplate syndrome, a starter package that is supposed to ease the pain of creating a new project but then soon becomes a huge blob that tries to suit every possible setup.
I wanted something that would let me start writing code with a minimal footprint, that could be eventually improved if necessary.</description>

      <title>Guide on React with Laravel 5.4</title>

      <description>Laravel 5.4 comes shipped with a nice integration with Vuejs, you install the framework and everything is already in place, there are even few example files you can start from, but what about React?
Vuejs is a great framework, but I like the less conventional approach of React and the more active community, and thanks to the amazing Laravel Mix, switching to React is a no brainer.
Create a Laravel project composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel laravel-react  And install the npm dependencies</description>

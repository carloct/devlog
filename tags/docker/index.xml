      <description>There are many pre-built solutions for setting up a Laravel + Docker environment, they&amp;rsquo;re all excellent solutions, but too complex for my needs 90% of the times.
It&amp;rsquo; s the boilerplate syndrome, a starter package that is supposed to ease the pain of creating a new project but then soon becomes a huge blob that tries to suit every possible setup.
I wanted something that would let me start writing code with a minimal footprint, that could be eventually improved if necessary.</description>

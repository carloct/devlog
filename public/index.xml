      <description>Loop analysis It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that the time complexity, and in particular the big O notation is an aproximation and it is supposed to represents only the growth in relation of a variable input. It&amp;rsquo;s not the sum of the time taken by each algorithm step, it&amp;rsquo;s a measurement of the computation time growth for an arbitrary, variable input. Anything constant can be ignored
O(1) Represent the time complexity of an algorithms which doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform any loop, recursion, or call to a non time-costant function</description>

      <title>Minimal Docker setup for Laravel on macOS</title>

      <description>There are many pre-built solutions for setting up a Laravel + Docker environment, they&amp;rsquo;re all excellent solutions, but too complex for my needs 90% of the times.
It&amp;rsquo; s the boilerplate syndrome, a starter package that is supposed to ease the pain of creating a new project but then soon becomes a huge blob that tries to suit every possible setup.
I wanted something that would let me start writing code with a minimal footprint, that could be eventually improved if necessary.</description>

      <description>PhpStorm has a built-in support for PSR1/2 standards, it can easily be enabled in the Preferences menu.
Type Code Style in the search box if you can&amp;rsquo;t see it
Then select PHP from the sub-menu. Now, practically hidden in the right upper corner, there&amp;rsquo;s a link (button?) Set from&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s unclear why such a widely used setting is a floating writing in the interface.
Select Predefined Styles &amp;gt; PSR1/PSR2

      <title>Guide on React with Laravel 5.4</title>
      <link>https://dazzling-kowalevski-2b6f01.netlify.com/blog/laravel-react-guide/</link>

      <description>Laravel 5.4 comes shipped with a nice integration with Vuejs, you install the framework and everything is already in place, there are even few example files you can start from, but what about React?
Vuejs is a great framework, but I like the less conventional approach of React and the more active community, and thanks to the amazing Laravel Mix, switching to React is a no brainer.
Create a Laravel project composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel laravel-react  And install the npm dependencies</description>
